## Case description

A bot is an autonomous program that interacts with people or computer systems in a predictable way. The logic behind a bot is designed and programmed by the bot creator, often with the help of tools like the Microsoft Bot Framework. Microsoft also has other AI services, included in Azure Cognitive Services, that can enhance the capabilities of your bots.

### Use cURL to query for an FAQ answer


### Use cURL to query for the default answer

Any question that QnA Maker is not confident about receives the default answer. This answer is configured in the Azure portal. 

1. In the cURL-enabled terminal, replace `How large can my KB be?` with `x`. 

1. Run the cURL command and receive the JSON response, including the score and answer. 

    ```TXT
      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
    100   186  100   170  100    16    272     25 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   297{
      "answers": [
        {
          "questions": [],
          "answer": "No good match found in KB.",
          "score": 0.0,
          "id": -1,

### Chat with the Bot

![Screenshot 2022-10-08 163127 chat with bot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111121880/194706337-cb1b2de5-2539-4373-bc4f-db09f0d775c1.png)



### Add personnality with Chit-Chat 

Adding chit-chat to your bot makes it more conversational and engaging. The chit-chat feature in QnA maker allows you to easily add a pre-populated set of the top chit-chat, into your knowledge base (KB). This can be a starting point for your bot's personality, and it will save you the time and cost of writing them from scratch.

This dataset has about 100 scenarios of chit-chat in the voice of multiple personas, like Professional,Friendly and Witty.

Some examples of the different personalities are below. You can see all the personality [datasets](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-PersonalityChat/tree/master/CSharp/Datasets) along with details of the personalities.

For the user query of `When is your birthday?`, each personality has a styled response:

<!-- added quotes so acrolinx doesn't score these sentences -->
|Personality|Example|
|--|--|
|Professional|Age doesn't really apply to me.|
|Friendly|I don't really have an age.|
|Witty|I'm age-free.|
|Caring|I don't have an age.|
|Enthusiastic|I'm a bot, so I don't have an age.|
||

#### Add Chit-Chat in your KB

1. Download the English friendly [datasets on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-PersonalityChat/tree/master/CSharp/Datasets)

1. Go to qnamaker.ai portal. Select your KB and select **Settings** from the top menu.

1. Scroll down to **Manage knowledge base**

1. On **File name** sub section, click on **Add file** and add qna_chitchat_friendly.tsv file.



1. Click **Save and Train** from top menu.

1. Click on **Edit** for review the questions and answers.

1. Select the last page of questions and answers from the bottom of the table. The page shows questions and answers from the Chit-chat personality.

1. From the toolbar above the list of questions and answers, select the View options icon, and then select Show metadata. This shows the metadata tags for each question and answer. The Chit-chat questions have the editorial: chit-chat metadata already set. This metadata is returned to the client application, along with the selected answer. The client application, such as a chat bot, can use this filtered metadata to determine additional processing or interactions with the user.

 



#### Use cURL to query for a Chit-chat answer

1. In the cURL-enabled terminal, replace `How large can my KB be?` with a bot conversation-ending statement from the user, such as `Thank you`.   

1. Run the cURL command and receive the JSON response, including the score and answer. 

    ```TXT
      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
    100   525  100   501  100    24    525     25 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   550{

            "Kthx",
            "I appreciate it",
            "Thank you so much",
            "I thank you",
            "My sincere thank"
          ],
          "answer": "You're very welcome.",
          "score": 100.0,
          "id": 109,
          "source": "qna_chitchat_the_friend.tsv",

              "value": "chitchat"
            }
          ]
